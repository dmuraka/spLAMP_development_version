# spCL (dev version): Coarse-to-Fine spatial modeling
R functions for spatial prediction and uncertainty modeling using coarse-to-fine spatial modeling (CFSM), a fast, validation-based framework that can be readily integrated with existing machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests):
- cf_lm_functions.R: Function implementing the CFSM
- sample_code.R   : Sample code for spatial prediction using meuse data.

The R package spCL is currently under development and will be released on CRAN in near future.
